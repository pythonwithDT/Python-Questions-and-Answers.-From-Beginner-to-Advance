Certainly! Let's break down the code:

1. **Declaration of the Original List**: 

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

    Here, we define a list named `numbers` containing integer elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.


2. **List Comprehension to Convert Numbers to Strings**:

    ```python
    str_numbers = [str(num) for num in numbers]
    ```

    This line uses list comprehension, a concise way to create lists in Python. It iterates over each element `num` in the `numbers` list and converts it to a string using the `str()` function. The resulting string is then stored in the list `str_numbers`.

    - `str(num)`: Converts each number in the `numbers` list to its string representation.
    - `for num in numbers`: Iterates over each element `num` in the `numbers` list.
    

3. **Printing the `str_numbers` List**:

    ```python
    print(str_numbers)
    ```

    This line prints the `str_numbers` list, which contains the string representations of the numbers originally in the `numbers` list.

So, the output of this code will be:

```
['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
```

It's a list of strings where each element corresponds to the string representation of the numbers in the original list.
