Let's break down the code:

Sure, let's continue breaking down the code:

1. **Creation of the New List of Even Numbers**:

    ```python
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    ```

    In this line, a new list named `even_numbers` is created using list comprehension. It iterates through each element `num` in the `numbers` list and checks if `num % 2 == 0`. If the condition is satisfied (indicating that `num` is even), it includes `num` in the `even_numbers` list.

2. **Printing the Original and New Lists**:

    ```python
    print("Original list:", numbers)
    print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
    ```

    These lines print the original list (`numbers`) and the new list of even numbers (`even_numbers`) to the console, providing a visual representation of the data before and after the filtering process.
