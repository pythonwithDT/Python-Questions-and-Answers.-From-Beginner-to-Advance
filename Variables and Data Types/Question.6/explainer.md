Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Prompting for Input:**
    ```python
    hrs = input("Input Hours: ")
    rt = input("Input Rate: ")
    ```
    The program prompts the user to input the number of hours worked (`hrs`) and the hourly rate (`rt`). The `input()` function reads the input as a string.

2. **Converting Input to Float:**
    ```python
    flhrs = float(hrs)
    flrt = float(rt)
    ```
    The `float()` function converts the input strings (`hrs` and `rt`) to floating-point numbers (`flhrs` and `flrt`). This conversion allows arithmetic operations to be performed on the input values.

3. **Calculating Gross Pay:**
    ```python
    py = flhrs * flrt
    ```
    The program calculates the gross pay (`py`) by multiplying the number of hours (`flhrs`) worked by the hourly rate (`flrt`). This computation follows the formula: Gross Pay = Hours Worked * Hourly Rate.

4. **Displaying the Result:**
    ```python
    print("Pay: ", py)
    ```
    Finally, the program prints the computed gross pay (`py`) to the console, along with the label "Pay:".

This program allows users to input the number of hours worked and the hourly rate, computes the gross pay based on the provided inputs, and then displays the result. The `float()` function ensures that the program can handle both integer and decimal input values for hours and rates.
